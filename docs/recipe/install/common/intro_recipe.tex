Recipes will instantiate a baremetal HPC head node (a.k.a. sms node) and baremetal HPC compute nodes (a.k.a CN) using pre-configured OpenStack images. The terms "head" and "sms" are used interchangeably in this guide.

OS Images are built using components from the OpenHPC software stack. OpenHPC represents an aggregation of a number of common ingredients required to deploy and manage an HPC Linux* cluster including resource management, I/O clients, development tools, and a variety of scientific libraries. These packages have been pre-built with HPC integration in mind using a mix of open-source components. The documentation herein is intended to be reasonably generic,
but uses the underlying motivation of a small, 4-node state-full cluster installation to define a step-by-step process. 

Several optional customizations are included and the intent is that these collective instructions can be modified as needed for local site customizations.
