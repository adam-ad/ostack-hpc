   This guide uses diskimage-builder utility to build and configure OS images 
for the sms (controller) node as well as compute nodes.  Preparing images is 
an optional part of the overall recipe. If user has predefined images, then 
environment variable "chpc\_create\_new\_image" must be reset and 
path to images must be provided using environment variable "chpc\_image\_deploy\_kernel", "chpc\_image\_deploy\_ramdisk",
"chpc\_image\_user", and "chpc\_image\_sms". 

In this example cloud images are built on controller node ("[ctrlr]\# "). Once images are built, they are stored in the standard openHPC Path.
In this recipe we will create utility functions for each functionality and then integrate them to make a complete receipe to create a compute node OS image. First setup a path for images to be stored.
