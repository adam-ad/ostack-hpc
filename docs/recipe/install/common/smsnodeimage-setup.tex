	Building head node (SMS) images requires installing the server packages of HPC components into the image. This is accomplished by setting the image type to "sms". The default image type in HPC elements is "compute". We will create a function prepare\_sms\_image to build this image, which will be called later in the document.

[ctrlr](*\#*) function prepare_sms_image() {
\end{lstlisting} 
% end_ohpc_run

	Check if the user has requested to create images by verifying environment variables chpc\_create\_new\_image and chpc\_image\_sms. If the user has supplied images then we will copy images to our common image location and setup environment variables for later use.

	If the user has not supplied images then we will build the sms image here. Disk-image-builder supports two types of HPC images, "sms" and "compute".
