        In this section we will update compute node states with HPC resource manager on the SMS node so that resource manager can launch HPC jobs on these new compute nodes.
        Before continuing, please make sure that all the cloud instances, "sms node" and "compute nodes" are up. When all these nodes are up, update cwresource manager.
