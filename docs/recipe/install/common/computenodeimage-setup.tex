	To build compute node images, we need to install the client packages of HPC components. This is accomplished by setting the image type to "compute". Note the default image type in HPC elements is "compute". We will then instruct disk-image-builder to install client HPC packages one by one. All of these action will be completed in the shell function prepare\_user\_images.

	Check if the user has already supplied compute node images by checking the environment variables:
	
		 chpc\_create\_new\_image and chpc\_image\_user.
		  
	If the image is supplied then we will copy that image to the OHPC image location and setup our environemnt variable to point to the image location.
