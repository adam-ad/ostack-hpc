OpenStack uses cloud-init for boot time initialization of cloud instances. This recipe relies on cloud-init to initialize HPC instances in an OpenStack cloud. This recipe prepares cloud-init initialization template script, which is than updated with sms-ip and other environment variables just before the provisioning. This is than fed as user data to Nova during instance creation. Script generated here will be executed by root during boot.
