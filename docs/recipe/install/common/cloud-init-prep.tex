	OpenStack uses cloud-init for boot time initialization of cloud instances. This recipe relies on cloud-init to initialize HPC instances in an OpenStack cloud. This recipe prepares the cloud-init initialization template script, which is then updated with sms-ip and other environment variables just before the provisioning. This is than fed as user data to Nova during instance creation. The script generated here will be executed by root during bootup. 
The cloud-init templates are provided as a part "docs-chpc" RPM and installed at {\em /opt/ohpc/pub/doc/recipes/centos7/x86\_64/openstack/slurm/cloud\_hpc\_init/ohpc}. Here we will create a similar tempalte and store this template into the same path.
