\subsection{Target Audience}

This guide is targeted at experienced \Linux{} system administrators 
for HPC environments. Knowledge of software package management, system 
networking, PXE booting and OpenStack system software is assumed. 
Command-line input examples are highlighted throughout this guide via the 
following syntax:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,literate={-}{-}1,keywords={},upquote=true]
[sms](*\#*) echo "OpenHPC hello world"
\end{lstlisting}

Unless specified otherwise, the examples presented are executed with
elevated (root) privileges. The examples also presume use of the BASH login
shell, though the equivalent commands in other shells can be substituted.
In addition to specific command-line instructions called out in this guide, an
alternate convention is used to highlight potentially useful tips or optional
configuration options. These tips are highlighted via the following format:
