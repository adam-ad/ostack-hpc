### README for HPCaaS - OpenHPC* on Openstack* documentation


This README covers compiling the documentation and creating the output into multiple formats, but primarily the PDF, from a LaTeX structure.


There are two ways to run, A.) in a clean, never run environment, or B.) Re-running make in a directory that has already generated files.


	CLEAN INSTALL

	If you have never run make from your current working directory, you will likely need 
	to install LaTeX, both the make and texlive packages, as well as several plugins the 
	OHPC documentation requires.  
	

	Building from makefile in a clean directory:

		You will need a few prequisites

			texlive
			texlive-multirow
			texlive-tcolorbox
			latexmk
			make

	Yum will need access to the CentOS base and EPEL repositoiries.

	To install:


		[user@localhost]$ sudo yum -y install texlive texlive-multirow texlive-tcolorbox latexmk make

	
	Assuming a standard load, and dependencies, you will likely see ~ 200 packages (mostly texlive pacakges) installed. 
	If you are not running a GUI, you may see higher package counts. If you already have some of these installed, the yum command
	will skip installing the already met dependencies.

		

	You should now be able to run `make`, and the Makefile will do its work. 

		Troubleshooting:
		
		If you've made changes to the steps.tex or any of the input <>.tex files, you may not be able to compile if
		you have typo's.  A few easy to miss typos are unmatched brackets, quotes, or braces and/or unescaped special 
		characters, such as underscores (_), backslashes (\), or sigils ($, %, &, etc).
		
		If all of the files generated by the make already exist, you will get a successful run, but no new output. 
		You must clear out the old files first. See the next section.


	PREVIOUS RUNS

	You will need to clear existing output files before regenerating a new PDF doc. 
	
	If you want to just remove the existing files, just delete them with this command.
	
		
		[user@localhost]$ for i in fdb_latexmk log aux fls pdf toc out syntec*; do rm -rf steps.$i; done


	If you want to keep and compare the old outputs with new ones, simply move the offending files to a new dir.


		[user@localhost]$ mkdir OLD_FILES            ###rename directory or files as necessary
		[user@localhost]$ for i in fdb_latexmk log aux fls pdf toc out syntec*; do mv steps.$i OLD_FILES ; done
		[user@localhost]$ make


	



	After running the docs, if you want to generate the recipe scripts, you will need to run the parse_docs.pl script 
	on the steps.tex file after generating your PDFs. Read the README for that script


	##**##**   I will add the parse_docs.pl script shortly, and add the location for it and its README once loaded  **##**##
