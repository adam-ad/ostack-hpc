This README covers generating recipe scripts from the HPCaaS documentation.

To generate scripts-

	1.) Make sure the input file in create_recipes.sh is correct.
	2.) ./create_recipes.sh

At current, this will publish the 4 recipes the docs generate.

prepare_chpc_image
prepare_cloud_init
deploy_chpc_openstack 
prepare_chpc_openstack


More will be added as necessary
