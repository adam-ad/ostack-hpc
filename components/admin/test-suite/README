In the project root, there is a dir named `tests`. As the user, or OBS, this needs to be renamed from '{chpc project root}/tests' to ' tests-chpc'

Then create the tar file with

                `tar -cf tests-chpc.tar tests-chpc`.

Move the tar file to the components/admin/test-suite/SOURCES/

                `mv tests-chpc.tar components/admin/test-suite/SOURCES/`

Copy the CHPC_macros file to SOURCES, too. (Don't use `mv`- this file is used by multiple spec files for rpmbuild)

                `cp components/CHPC_macros components/admin/tests-chpc/SOURCES/`

Then build the rpm

                `cd component/admin/test-suite; rpmbuild -bb SPECS/tests-chpc.spec`
