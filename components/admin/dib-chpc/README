 In the project root, there is a dir named `dib`. This needs to be renamed from '{chpc project root}/dib' to ' dib-chpc'

Then create the tar file with

                `tar -cf dib-chpc.tar dib-chpc`.

Copy the tar file to the components/admin/dib-chpc/SOURCES/

		`cp dib-chpc.tar components/admin/dib-chpc/SOURCES/`

Copy the CHPC_macros file to SOURCES, too.

		`cp components/CHPC_macros components/admin/dib-chpc/SOURCES/`

Then build the rpm
	
		`cd component/admin/dib-chpc; rpmbuild -bb SPECS/dib-chpc.spec`
