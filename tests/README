This directory maintains integration tests for HPC in cloud
all the tests are derived from openhpc except "dib" & "ostack"

Tests are grouped into controller tests and sms tests.
Test script HPC_in_oscloud-tests is used for continuous integrations
tests. this script is expected to run on controller node. It executes
all controller tests first followed by sms test. For sms tests, it
ssh into sms node and executes the same test.
