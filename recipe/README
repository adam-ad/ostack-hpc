This directory "hpc/recipe" maintains the recipe for HPC in Cloud.
Overall recipe is combination of various scripts to orchestrate HPC envrionment.
main provide for recipe is a shell script setup_cloud_hpc.sh, after input  
verification it launches cloud recipe set_os_hpc (short for setup OpenStack 
HPC), which then calls other scripts to complete the hpc provision in a 
cloud.  Below are the use cases of HPC in cloud
   use case 1: Here HPC head node is installed as a part of OpenStack controller
               node.
   use case 2: Here HPC head node is outside of OpenStack controller node and 
               reside along with on premise HPC system. in this use case on 
               premise HPC head node is exanded with more nodes from OpenStack 
               cloud. both systems are on premise and physicall conected via 
               ethernet and high speed fabric.
   use case 3: a VPN tunnel is created between HPC System and OpenStack cloud system.

Below is the detail on different files and directories in this folder "hpc/recipe"

file: setup_cloud_hpc.sh
==================
this is command line utility written in bash shall script. This is the parent of
all other recipe in this folder. This utility takes user input, validate the 
user input, validates the configuration file supplied by user and then invokes 
set_os_hpc scripts.  It supports both OpenHPC and HPC Orchestrator.

file: set_os_hpc
================
this is the script to setup HPC in OpenStack Cloud. To perform the job it 
execute other scripts.

file: prepare_cloudInit
======================
this sripts generates cloudinit script (chpcInit), which is supplied to Nova to
boot the baremetal nodes.

file: prepare_chpc_image
========================
this generates HPC images for provisioning bare metal cloud nodes. It generates 
3 images
     Two deploy images for ironic to use 
         1. icloud-hpc-deploy-c7.kernel
         2. icloud-hpc-deply-c7.initramfs
     One user image
         3. icloud-hpc-cent7.qcow2

file: prepare_chpc_openstack
============================
this script prepares nova, ironic for baremetal provisioning, installs and 
configure pxe boot, pxe-impmi driver for ironic, and enable cloud init for 
baremetal nodes.

File: deploy_chpc_openstack
===========================
This script deploy baremetal nodes in an openstack using nova, ironic, neutron 
and glance by using cloudinit recipe (prepare under prepare_cloudInit) and HPC
images (prepared by prepare_chpc_image).

file: update_cnodes_to_sms
==========================
this script perform the post boot configuration including updating SLURM 
resource manager for new cloud node

file: common_function
=====================
this is library of common bash functions used by different scripts

file: gen_cn_mac
================
this is an script to get the MAC address of compute nodes via IPMI.

directory: CloudHPCInit
=======================
maintains the template for cloud-init script, which is updated at run time 
before supplying to nova as an user data.

directory: hpc_cent7
====================
maintains a copy of recipe for HPC Orchestrator and OpenHPC. warewulf 
is removed from these recipe to insteall head node functionality on 
OpenStack controller node.

directory: inventory
====================
maintains configuration files for OpenHPC, HPC Orchestrator and Cloud 
baremetal node. these configuration files are applicable for development 
systems used for prototype.

directory 2_cloudExtension
==========================
maintans the recipe for cloud burst use case (user case 2)
