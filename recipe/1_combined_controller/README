This directory "hpc/recipe/1_combined_controller" maintains the recipes for use
case 1, where the OpenStack controller node and HPC head node are the same 
physical node in a cloud system.
Below are the scripts called to create the environment for use case 1:

file: set_os_hpc
================
This is the script to setup HPC in OpenStack Cloud. This script is called by 
setup_cloud_hpc.sh if user provides a "-u=1" input to it. To perform the job it 
execute other scripts.

file: prepare_cloud_init
======================
This sripts generates cloudinit script (chpcInit), which is supplied to Nova to
boot the baremetal nodes.

file: prepare_chpc_image
========================
This generates HPC images for provisioning bare metal cloud nodes. It generates 
3 images
     Two deploy images for ironic to use 
         1. icloud-hpc-deploy-c7.kernel
         2. icloud-hpc-deply-c7.initramfs
     One user image
         3. icloud-hpc-cent7.qcow2
		 
file: prepare_chpc_openstack
============================
This script prepares nova, ironic for baremetal provisioning, installs and 
configure pxe boot, pxe-impmi driver for ironic, and enable cloud init for 
baremetal nodes.

File: deploy_chpc_openstack
===========================
This script deploy baremetal nodes in an openstack using nova, ironic, neutron 
and glance by using cloudinit recipe (prepare under prepare_cloudInit) and HPC
images (prepared by prepare_chpc_image).

file: update_cnodes_to_sms
==========================
This script perform the post boot configuration including updating SLURM 
resource manager for new cloud node
