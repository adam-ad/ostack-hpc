# VPN client configuration file to push desired configuraiton to vpn client
# client is identified by certificate name. In our case we created 
# certificate with name cloudhead for client.


# Add HPC System network to cloud head node, so that cloud nodes can access HPC system.
# This route will be pushed by vpn server to client
# assuming HPC head node has local subnet on 10.78.6.0/24, so route need to be added to for traffic 
# to route via VPN tunnel. this line will add the route. cloud compute node need to add additional route, 

iroute 10.78.6.0 255.255.255.248
# push VPN client IP Address
# ifconfig-push client_vpn_ip_address server_vpn_ip_address
# we are using server VPN IP address 192.168.68.1 and client VPN IP 192.168.68.2
ifconfig-push 192.168.68.2 192.168.68.1
push "route 192.168.47.0 255.255.255.0"
