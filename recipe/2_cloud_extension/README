This directory "hpc/recipe/1_combined_controller" maintains the recipes for use
case 2, where the OpenStack* controller node and HPC head node are two different
systems in 2 different clusters, but are considered "on-premise" and connected
via ethernet and/or high-speed cable.
Below are the scripts called to create the environment for use case 2:

file: set_os_hpc
================
This is the script to setup HPC in OpenStack* Cloud. To perform the job it 
execute other scripts.

file: prepare_cloud_init
======================
this sripts generates cloudinit script (chpcInit), which is supplied to Nova to
boot the baremetal nodes.

file: prepare_chpc_image
========================
This generates HPC images for provisioning bare metal cloud nodes. It generates 
3 images
     Two deploy images for ironic to use 
         1. icloud-hpc-deploy-c7.kernel
         2. icloud-hpc-deply-c7.initramfs
     One user image
         3. icloud-hpc-cent7.qcow2
		 
file: deploy_chpc_openstack
===========================
This script deploy baremetal nodes in an OpenStack* using nova*, ironic*, neutron* 
and glance* by using cloudinit* recipe (prepare under prepare_cloudInit) and HPC
images (prepared by prepare_chpc_image).

file: update_cnodes_to_sms
==========================
This script perform the post boot configuration including updating SLURM* 
resource manager for new cloud node

directory: ovpn
==================
This maintains the openvpn* specific files, setup and configuration needed to 
create vpn tunnel between two system
