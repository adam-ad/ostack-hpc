This directory "hpc/recipe/3_hpc_as_service" maintains the recipes for use
case 3. In this case OpenStack provides baremetal nodes and recipe
creates one of the bare metal node as HPC head node and create other 
remaining bare metals as HPC compute nodes.
it provides recipe to create HPC head node images as well as hpc
compute node images.
for hpc configuration it creates cloud-init script (post boot script)
for each type of nodes (SMS as well CN)
This use case can be invoked as below:
../setup_cloud_hpc.sh -i=inventory/3_hpc_as_service/hn3_has_input.local -u=3 -n=inventory/3_hpc_as_service/hn3_has_inventory

Below are the scripts called to create the environment for use case 1:

file: set_os_hpc
================
This is the script to setup HPC in OpenStack Cloud. This script is called by 
setup_cloud_hpc.sh if user provides a "-u=3" input to it. To perform the job,
it executes other scripts.

file: prepare_cloud_init
======================
This sripts generates cloudinit script (chpcInit) for both sms node as well as
compute nodes, which is supplied to Nova to boot the nodes.

file: prepare_chpc_image
========================
This generates HPC images for provisioning bare metal cloud nodes. It generates 
3 images
     Two deploy images for ironic to use 
         1. icloud-hpc-deploy-c7.kernel
         2. icloud-hpc-deply-c7.initramfs
     One user image for compute node
         3. icloud-hpc-cent7.qcow2
     One user image for hpc head node (sms)
         4. icloud-hpc-cent7-sms.qcow2
		 
file: prepare_chpc_openstack
============================
This script prepares nova, ironic for baremetal provisioning, installs and 
configure pxe boot, pxe-impmi driver for ironic, and enable cloud init for 
baremetal nodes.
It also configure neutron for internal dns service

File: deploy_chpc_openstack
===========================
This script deploy baremetal nodes in an openstack using nova, ironic, neutron 
and glance by using cloudinit recipe (prepare under prepare_cloudInit) and HPC
images (prepared by prepare_chpc_image).
it first deploys sms node and then deploy compute nodes.

file: update_cnodes_to_sms
==========================
This script perform the post boot configuration including updating SLURM 
resource manager at sms node for hpc compute nodes
