It is a utility to build and configure OS images for sms node as well compute node. It uses prebuild minimum OS images from base distro, which it further customizes as per user request. Diskimage-builder is a framework which uses many elements (similar to plug-ins) to customize the image. Base distribution of diskimage-builder comes with pre-defined elements. This recipe uses additional HPC elements which were built to customize images based on OpenHPC components.

\subsubsection{HPC Elements to build OpenHPC Images}

"HPC as a service" uses 4 HPC specific elements in addition to pre-packaged elements comes with diskimage-builder.

hpc-dev-env: 
	This is mainly used to create sms images to create HPC development environment. It creates hpc development environment by installing following OpenHPC components within image: 
		ohpc-autotools, valgrind-ohpc, easybuild-ohpc, spack-ohpc, r\_base-ohpc
		mpi and compiler for chosen MPI and compiler via environment variable, \$DIB\_HPC\_COMPILER, \$DIB\_HPC\_MPI
		Performance Tools lmod-default with their 3rd party libraries.
