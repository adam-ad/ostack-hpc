The term "HPC as a Service" refers to an on demand instantiation of HPC Service in a Cloud environment. This guide presents a simple "HPC cluster" instantiation procedure on an existing OpenStack (Mitaka) system. "HPC as a service" relies on two main principals to instantiate HPC service :


\begin{list}{}
	\item 	1. Providing pre-built OS images for compute nodes with HPC optimized software and 
	\item   2. Use of cloud-init to configure and tune HPC services.
	 
\end{list}
	
This document provides a simple guide to build HPC optimized OS images, prepare cloud-init recipes and finally instantiate a fully functional HPC System using those images and cloud-init. 

Recipes will instantiate and HPC master node (a.k.a. sms node) and HPC compute nodes using pre-configured OpenStack images. The terms "master" and "sms" are used interchangeably in this guide.

OS Images are built using components from the OpenHPC software stack. OpenHPC represents an aggregation of a number of common ingredients required to deploy and manage an HPC Linux* cluster including resource management, I/O clients, development tools, and a variety of scientific libraries. These packages have been pre-built with HPC integration in mind using a mix of open-source components. The documentation herein is intended to be reasonably generic,
but uses the underlying motivation of a small, 4-node state-full cluster installation to define a step-by-step process. 

Several optional customizations are included and the intent is that these collective instructions can be modified as needed for local site customizations.
