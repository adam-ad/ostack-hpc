# ostack-hpc

### Introduction
This project enables HPC environment in an OpenStack cloud. It takes ingredients from OpenHPC and combines with OpenStack automations to create HPC environment. 
Below are the two main use cases:
##### HPC as a Service
In this case completely independent HPC environment is created within an OpenStack cloud. This includes creation of HPC head node and HPC compute nodes.
##### HPC Cloud Burst
In this case existing HPC system (OpenHPC based) is extended with additional resource from OpenStack cloud. same HPC resource manager can lanuch jobs on cloud computes.
